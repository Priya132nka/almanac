# Almanac

Implementation and evaluation of Almanac (Automaton/Logic Multi-Agent Natural Actor-Critic), an algorithm for [Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Temporal Logic Specifications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00582). A preliminary version of this work appeared at AAMAS-21, the code for which has been archived on the branch `almanac/aamas`. An updated version is forthcoming and will be pushed to the branch `almanac/main`. If you use or reference this work in your own publications, please use the following citation:
