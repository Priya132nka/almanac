Computing reachable states...

Reachability (BFS): 8 iterations in 0.00 seconds (average 0.000000, setup 0.00)

Time for model construction: 0.096 seconds.

Type:        MDP
States:      249 (1 initial)
Transitions: 2602
Choices:     2601

Transition matrix: 2067 nodes (4 terminal), 2602 minterms, vars: 12r/12c/9nd

Building deterministic automaton (for X (F G "L0"))...
DRA has 3 states, 1 Rabin pairs.
Time for deterministic automaton translation: 0.248 seconds.

Constructing MDP-DRA product...

Reachability (BFS): 8 iterations in 0.00 seconds (average 0.000000, setup 0.00)
Time for product construction: 0.007 seconds.

States:      269 (1 initial)
Transitions: 3102

Computing reachability probabilities...

Prob0A: 5 iterations in 0.00 seconds (average 0.000400, setup 0.00)

Prob1E: 6 iterations in 0.00 seconds (average 0.000333, setup 0.00)

yes = 269, no = 0, maybe = 0

Value in the initial state: 1.0

Time for model checking: 0.335 seconds.

Result: 1.0 (value in the initial state)
