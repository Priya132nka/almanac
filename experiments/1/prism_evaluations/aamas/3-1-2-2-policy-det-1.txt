DRA has 4 states, 1 Rabin pairs.
Time for deterministic automaton translation: 0.242 seconds.

Constructing MC-DRA product...

Reachability (BFS): 7 iterations in 0.00 seconds (average 0.000000, setup 0.00)

States:      35 (1 initial)
Transitions: 42

Transition matrix: 313 nodes (10 terminal), 42 minterms, vars: 17r/17c

Finding accepting BSCCs...

SCCs: 8, BSCCs: 8, non-BSCC states: 19
BSCC sizes: 1:2 2:2 3:2 4:2 5:2 6:2 7:2 8:2

Computing reachability probabilities...

Prob0: 5 iterations in 0.00 seconds (average 0.000200, setup 0.00)

Prob1: 1 iterations in 0.00 seconds (average 0.000000, setup 0.00)

yes = 35, no = 0, maybe = 0

Value in the initial state: 1.0

Time for model checking: 0.3 seconds.

Result: 1.0 (value in the initial state)
