States:      619 (1 initial)
Transitions: 4649
Choices:     4441

Transition matrix: 2779 nodes (34 terminal), 4649 minterms, vars: 16r/16c/8nd

Building deterministic automaton (for X (F G "L0"))...
DRA has 3 states, 1 Rabin pairs.
Time for deterministic automaton translation: 0.269 seconds.

Prob0A: 5 iterations in 0.00 seconds (average 0.000600, setup 0.00)

Prob1E: 6 iterations in 0.00 seconds (average 0.000167, setup 0.00)

yes = 665, no = 0, maybe = 0

Value in the initial state: 1.0

Time for model checking: 0.42 seconds.

Result: 1.0 (value in the initial state)
