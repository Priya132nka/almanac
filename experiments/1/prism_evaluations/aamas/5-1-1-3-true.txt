Choices:     1545

Transition matrix: 3800 nodes (166 terminal), 2066 minterms, vars: 17r/17c/5nd

Building deterministic automaton (for X (F G "L0"))...
DRA has 3 states, 1 Rabin pairs.
Time for deterministic automaton translation: 0.255 seconds.

Constructing MDP-DRA product...

Reachability (BFS): 10 iterations in 0.00 seconds (average 0.000300, setup 0.00)
Time for product construction: 0.01 seconds.

States:      710 (1 initial)
Transitions: 2266

Prob0A: 5 iterations in 0.00 seconds (average 0.000400, setup 0.00)

Prob1E: 6 iterations in 0.00 seconds (average 0.000333, setup 0.00)

yes = 710, no = 0, maybe = 0

Value in the initial state: 1.0

Time for model checking: 0.502 seconds.

Result: 1.0 (value in the initial state)
